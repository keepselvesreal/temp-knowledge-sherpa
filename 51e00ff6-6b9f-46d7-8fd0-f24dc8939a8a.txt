  WordPress is well-known for its ease of installation. Under most              
  circumstances, installing WordPress is a very simple process and takes        
  less than five minutes to complete. Many web hosts now offer tools (e.g.      
  Fantastico) to automatically install WordPress for you. However, if you       
  wish to install WordPress yourself, the following guide will help.            
                                                                                
  Things to Know Before Installing WordPress                                    
  Before you begin the install, there are a few things you need to have and     
  do. Refer the article Before You Install. It’s also good to verify that       
  e-mail delivery is working properly on your host. Refer to Mail for more      
  information.                                                                  
  If you need multiple WordPress instances, refer Installing Multiple           
  WordPress Instances..                                                         
                                                                                
  Basic Instructions                                                            
  Here’s the quick version of the instructions for those who are already        
  comfortable with performing such installations. More detailed                 
  instructions follow.                                                          
                                                                                
  Download and unzip the WordPress package if you haven’t already.              
  Create a database for WordPress on your web server, as well as a MySQL        
  (or MariaDB) user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying it.      
  (Optional) Find and rename wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php, then        
  edit the file (see Editing wp-config.php) and add your database               
  information.                                                                  
  Note: If you are not comfortable with renaming files, step 3 is optional      
  and you can skip it as the install program will create the wp-config.php      
  file for you.                                                                 
  Upload the WordPress files to the desired location on your web server:        
  If you want to integrate WordPress into the root of your domain (e.g.         
  https://example.com/), move or upload all contents of the unzipped            
  WordPress directory (excluding the WordPress directory itself) into the       
  root directory of your web server.                                            
  If you want to have your WordPress installation in its own subdirectory       
  on your website (e.g. https://example.com/blog/), create the blog             
  directory on your server and upload the contents of the unzipped              
  WordPress package to the directory via FTP.                                   
  Note: If your FTP client has an option to convert file names to lower         
  case, make sure it’s disabled.                                                
  Run the WordPress installation script by accessing the URL in a web           
  browser. This should be the URL where you uploaded the WordPress files.       
  – If you installed WordPress in the root directory, you should visit:         
  https://example.com/                                                          
  – If you installed WordPress in its own subdirectory called blog, for         
  example, you should visit: https://example.com/blog/                          
  That’s it! WordPress should now be installed.                                 
                                                                                
  Detailed instructions                                                         
  Step 1: Download and Extract                                                  
  Download and unzip the WordPress package from wordpress.org/download/.        
                                                                                
  If you will be uploading WordPress to a remote web server, download the       
  WordPress package to your computer with a web browser and unzip the           
  package.                                                                      
  If you will be using FTP, skip to the next step – uploading files is          
  covered later.                                                                
  If you have shell access to your web server, and are comfortable using        
  console-based tools, you may wish to download WordPress directly to your      
  web server using wget (or lynx or another console-based web browser) if       
  you want to avoid FTPing:                                                     
  wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz                                      
  Then extract the package using:                                               
  tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz                                                       
  The WordPress package will extract into a folder called wordpress in the      
  same directory that you downloaded latest.tar.gz.                             
                                                                                
  Step 2: Create a database for WordPress                                       
  If you are using a hosting provider, you may already have a WordPress         
  database set up for you, or there may be an automated setup solution to       
  do so. Check your hosting provider’s support pages or your control panel      
  for clues about whether or not you’ll need to create one manually.            
                                                                                
  If you determine that you’ll need to create one manually, follow the          
  instructions for Using phpMyAdmin below to create your WordPress username     
  and database. For other tools such as Plesk, cPanel and Using the MySQL       
  Client, refer the article Creating Database for WordPress.                    
                                                                                
  If you have only one database and it is already in use, you can install       
  WordPress in it – just make sure to have a distinctive prefix for your        
  tables to avoid over-writing any existing database tables.                    
                                                                                
  Using phpMyAdmin                                                              
  If your web server has phpMyAdmin installed, you may follow these             
  instructions to create your WordPress username and database. If you work      
  on your own computer, on most Linux distributions you can install             
  PhpMyAdmin automatically.                                                     
                                                                                
  Note: These instructions are written for phpMyAdmin 4.4; the phpMyAdmin       
  user interface can vary slightly between versions.                            
                                                                                
  If a database relating to WordPress does not already exist in the             
  Database dropdown on the left, create one:                                    
  Choose a name for your WordPress database: ‘wordpress‘ or ‘blog‘ are          
  good, but most hosting services (especially shared hosting) will require      
  a name beginning with your username and an underscore, so, even if you        
  work on your own computer, we advise that you check your hosting service      
  requirements so that you can follow them on your own server and be able       
  to transfer your database without modification. Enter the chosen database     
  name in the Create database field and choose the best collation for your      
  language and encoding. In most cases it’s better to choose in the             
  “utf8_” series and, if you don’t find your language, to choose                
  “utf8mb4_general_ci” (Refer this article about upgrading to utf8mb4).         
  ￼                                                                             
  Click the phpMyAdmin icon in the upper left to return to the main page,       
  then click the Users tab. If a user relating to WordPress does not            
  already exist in the list of users, create one:                               
  ￼                                                                             
  Click Add user.                                                               
  Choose a username for WordPress (‘wordpress‘ is good) and enter it in the     
  User name field. (Be sure Use text field: is selected from the                
  dropdown.)                                                                    
  Choose a secure password (ideally containing a combination of upper- and      
  lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols), and enter it in the Password       
  field. (Be sure Use text field: is selected from the dropdown.) Re-enter      
  the password in the Re-type field.                                            
  Write down the username and password you chose.                               
  Leave all options under Global privileges at their defaults.                  
  Click Go.                                                                     
  Return to the Users screen and click the Edit privileges icon on the user     
  you’ve just created for WordPress.                                            
  In the Database-specific privileges section, select the database you’ve       
  just created for WordPress under the Add privileges to the following          
  database dropdown, and click Go.                                              
  The page will refresh with privileges for that database. Click Check All      
  to select all privileges, and click Go.                                       
  On the resulting page, make note of the host name listed after Server: at     
  the top of the page. (This will usually be localhost.)                        
  ￼                                                                             
                                                                                
  Step 3: Set up wp-config.php                                                  
  You can either create and edit the wp-config.php file yourself, or you        
  can skip this step and let WordPress try to do this itself when you run       
  the installation script (step 5). (you’ll still need to tell WordPress        
  your database information).                                                   
                                                                                
  (For more extensive details, and step by step instructions for creating       
  the configuration file and your secret key for password security, please      
  see Editing wp-config.php).                                                   
                                                                                
  Return to where you extracted the WordPress package in Step 1, rename the     
  file wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php, and open it in a text             
  editor.                                                                       
                                                                                
  Enter your database information under the section labeled                     
                                                                                
  // ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //         
  DB_NAME                                                                       
  The name of the database you created for WordPress in Step 2.                 
  DB_USER                                                                       
  The username you created for WordPress in Step 2.                             
  DB_PASSWORD                                                                   
  The password you chose for the WordPress username in Step 2.                  
  DB_HOST                                                                       
  The hostname you determined in Step 2 (usually localhost, but not always;     
  see some possible DB_HOST values). If a port, socket, or pipe is              
  necessary, append a colon (:) and then the relevant information to the        
  hostname.                                                                     
  DB_CHARSET                                                                    
  The database character set, normally should not be changed (see Editing       
  wp-config.php).                                                               
  DB_COLLATE                                                                    
  The database collation should normally be left blank (see Editing             
  wp-config.php).                                                               
                                                                                
  Enter your secret key values under the section labeled                        
                                                                                
  /* Authentication Unique Keys and Salts. */                                   
  Save the wp-config.php file.                                                  
                                                                                
  Step 4: Upload the files                                                      
  Now you will need to decide where on your domain you’d like your              
  WordPress-powered site to appear:                                             
  – In the root directory of your website. (For example,                        
  https://example.com/)                                                         
  – In a subdirectory of your website. (For example,                            
  https://example.com/blog/)                                                    
                                                                                
  Note: The location of your root web directory in the filesystem on your       
  web server will vary across hosting providers and operating systems.          
  Check with your hosting provider or system administrator if you do not        
  know where this is.                                                           
                                                                                
  In the Root Directory                                                         
  If you need to upload your files to your web server, use an FTP client to     
  upload all the contents of the wordpress directory (but not the               
  directory itself) into the root directory of your website.                    
  If your files are already on your web server, and you are using shell         
  access to install WordPress, move all of the contents of the wordpress        
  directory (but not the directory itself) into the root directory of your      
  website.                                                                      
  In a Subdirectory                                                             
  If you need to upload your files to your web server, rename the wordpress     
  directory to your desired name, then use an FTP client to upload the          
  directory to your desired location within the root directory of your          
  website.                                                                      
  If your files are already on your web server, and you are using shell         
  access to install WordPress, move the wordpress directory to your desired     
  location within the root directory of your website, and rename the            
  directory to your desired name.                                               
  Step 5: Run the Install Script                                                
  Point a web browser to start the installation script.                         
                                                                                
  If you placed the WordPress files in the root directory, you should           
  visit: https://example.com/wp-admin/install.php                               
  If you placed the WordPress files in a subdirectory called blog, for          
  example, you should visit: https://example.com/blog/wp-admin/install.php      
  Setup configuration file                                                      
  If WordPress can’t find the wp-config.php file, it will tell you and          
  offer to try to create and edit the file itself. (You can also do this        
  directly by loading wp-admin/setup-config.php in your web browser.)           
  WordPress will ask you the database details and write them to a new           
  wp-config.php file. If this works, you can go ahead with the                  
  installation; otherwise, go back and create, edit, and upload the             
  wp-config.php file yourself (step 3).                                         
                                                                                
  ￼                                                                             
                                                                                
  Finishing installation                                                        
  The following screenshots show how the installation progresses. Notice        
  that in entering the details screen, you enter your site title, your          
  desired user name, your choice of a password (twice), and your e-mail         
  address. Also displayed is a check-box asking if you would like your blog     
  to appear in search engines like Google and DuckDuckGo. Leave the box         
  unchecked if you would like your blog to be visible to everyone,              
  including search engines, and check the box if you want to block search       
  engines, but allow normal visitors. Note all this information can be          
  changed later in your Administration Screen.                                  
                                                                                
  ￼                                                                             
                                                                                
  If you successfully install the WordPress, login prompt will be               
  displayed.                                                                    
                                                                                
  Install script troubleshooting                                                
  – If you get an error about the database when you run the install script:     
  – Go back to Step 2 and Step 3, and make sure you entered all the correct     
  database information into wp-config.php.                                      
  – Make sure you granted your WordPress user permission to access your         
  WordPress database in Step 3.                                                 
  – Make sure the database server is running.

  Common installation problems                                                  
  The following are some of the most common installation problems. For more     
  information and troubleshooting for problems with your WordPress              
  installation, check out FAQ Installation and FAQ Troubleshooting.             
                                                                                
  I see a directory listing rather than a web page.                             
                                                                                
  The web server needs to be told to view index.php by default. In Apache,      
  use the DirectoryIndex index.php directive. The simplest option is to         
  create a file named .htaccess in the installed directory and place the        
  directive there. Another option is to add the directive to the web            
  server’s configuration files.                                                 
                                                                                
  I see lots of Headers already sent errors. How do I fix this?                 
                                                                                
  You probably introduced a syntax error in editing wp-config.php.              
                                                                                
  Download wp-config.php (if you don’t have shell access).                      
  Open it in a text editor.                                                     
  Check that the first line contains nothing but , and that there is no         
  text after it (not even whitespace).                                          
  If your text editor saves as Unicode, make sure it adds no byte order         
  mark (BOM). Most Unicode-enabled text editors do not inform the user          
  whether or not it adds a BOM to files; if so, try using a different text      
  editor.                                                                       
  Save the file, upload it again if necessary, and reload the page in your      
  browser.                                                                      
  My page comes out gibberish. When I look at the source I see a lot of         
  “<?php ?>” tags.                                                              
                                                                                
  If the <?php ?> tags are being sent to the browser, it means your PHP is      
  not working properly. All PHP code is supposed to be executed before the      
  server sends the resulting HTML to your web browser. (That’s why it’s         
  called a preprocessor.) Make sure your web server meets the requirements      
  to run WordPress, that PHP is installed and configured properly, or           
  contact your hosting provider or system administrator for assistance.         
                                                                                
  I keep getting an Error connecting to database message but I’m sure my        
  configuration is correct.                                                     
                                                                                
  Try resetting your MySQL password manually. If you have access to MySQL

  If you do not have shell access, you should be able to simply enter the       
  above into an SQL query in phpMyAdmin. Failing that, you may need to use      
  your host’s control panel to reset the password for your database user.       
                                                                                
  I keep getting an Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL       
  extension which is required by WordPress message but I’m sure my              
  configuration is correct.                                                     
                                                                                
  Check to make sure that your configuration of your web-server is correct      
  and that the MySQL plugin is getting loaded correctly by your web-server      
  program. Sometimes this issue requires everything in the path all the way     
  from the web-server down to the MySQL installation to be checked and          
  verified to be fully operational. Incorrect configuration files or            
  settings are often the cause of this issue.                                   
                                                                                
  My image/MP3 uploads aren’t working.                                          
                                                                                
  If you use the Rich Text Editor on a blog that’s installed in a               
  subdirectory, and drag a newly uploaded image into the editor field, the      
  image may vanish a couple seconds later. This is due to a problem with        
  TinyMCE (the rich text editor) not getting enough information during the      
  drag operation to construct the path to the image or other file               
  correctly. The solution is to NOT drag uploaded images into the editor.       
  Instead, click and hold on the image and select Send to Editor. 로컬에

  Claude is now exploring and designing an implementation approach.

  1. Block theme vs Classic theme 중 어느 것 중심?                              
    - 현재 WordPress는 Block theme로 전환 중                                    
    - 추천: Block theme 학습을 메인으로, Classic theme는 비교 정도만            
  2. Template 범위 정의                                                         
    - index.php, single.php, archive.php 모두?                                  
    - 아니면 index.php + template parts로 간단히?                               
  3. wp-content/uploads 활용 방식

  **현대적인 구조(Block/JSON)**를 연결하여 이해하기에 매우 탁월한               
  구성입니다. 특히 1단계에서 가장 단순한 형태로부터 시작해 점진적으로           
  복잡도를 높여가는 방식은 학습 효율을 극대화할 수 있습니다.                    
                                                                                
  작성하신 커리큘럼에 대해 단계별 피드백과 학습 시 유의할 포인트를 정리해       
  드립니다.

  ### 1~2단계: 기초 구축 및 시스템 이해                                         
                                                                                
  * **피드백:** 1단계에서 이미지 표시(`uploads`)를 다루는 것은 경로(`URL`       
  vs `Path`)의 차이를 익히기에 좋습니다. 2단계에서 `theme.json`과               
  `functions.php`를 비교하는 지점은 블록 테마의 핵심 철학을 깨닫는 가장         
  중요한 순간이 될 것입니다.                                                    
  * **학습 팁:** `add_theme_support`로 선언하던 '기능 활성화'가                 
  `theme.json`의 `"settings"` 항목으로 어떻게 이관되었는지 대조표를             
  만들어보세요.                                                                 
                                                                                
  ### 3~4단계: 스타일링 및 에셋 최적화                                          
                                                                                
  * **피드백:** 4단계의 **'블록 단위 로딩'**은 현대 워드프레스 성능             
  최적화의 핵심입니다. 전체 사이트에 로드되는 무거운 `style.css` 대신,          
  필요한 블록이 있을 때만 로드되는 방식의 성능 이점을 데이터로 확인해           
  보시면 좋습니다.                                                              
  * **학습 팁:** `theme.json`에서 정의한 컬러 팔레트가 에디터 UI에 어떻게       
  반영되고, 실제 프론트엔드에서 어떤 CSS 변수(`--wp--preset--color--*`)로       
  생성되는지 연결 고리를 확인하세요.                                            
                                                                                
  ### 5~6단계: 로직 커스텀 및 최종 완성                                         
                                                                                
  * **피드백:** 5단계에서 이미지 처리를 Hook으로 다루는 것은 매우 실전적인      
  접근입니다. 6단계에서 앞서 배운 모든 로직(Actions/Filters)을 **블록의         
  속성(Attributes)**과 결합하여 시각적으로 조립하는 경험을 하게 될              
  것입니다.                                                                     
  * **학습 팁:** 5단계의 필터 학습 시, `the_content` 필터를 활용해 본문 내      
  이미지에 특정 클래스를 강제로 주입하거나 캡션을 수정하는 실습을               
  추천합니다.                                                                   
                                                                                
  ---                                                                           
                                                                                
  ### 💡 학습 효율을 높여줄 구조적 가이드                                       
                                                                                
  학습을 진행하시면서 아래의 **'선언적 방식 vs 명령적 방식'**의 차이를          
  염두에 두시면 더 깊은 통찰을 얻으실 수 있습니다.                              
                                                                                
  | 단계 | 방식 | 특징 | 비유 |                                                 
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |                                                     
  | **Old (Classic)** | **명령적 (Imperative)** | `functions.php`에 "이걸       
  해라"라고 일일이 코딩 | 레고 성을 본드로 붙여서 완성하기 |                    
  | **New (Block)** | **선언적 (Declarative)** | `theme.json`에 "이런           
  규칙을 갖겠다"고 명시 | 레고 조립 설명서를 만들고 블록으로 조립하기 |         
                                                                                
  ---                                                                           
                                                                                
  ### 🚀 추가 제안: 5.5단계 '데이터 구조화'                                     
                                                                                
  6단계로 넘어가기 전, **ACF(Advanced Custom Fields)**를 활용한 데이터          
  관리를 살짝 끼워 넣으시길 추천합니다.                                         
                                                                                
  * **이유:** 블록 테마의 진가는 단순한 디자인이 아니라, **"구조화된            
  데이터(책 저자, 평점 등)를 블록으로 어떻게 예쁘게 뿌려주는가"**에서           
  나오기 때문입니다.

  **1단계 '가장 단순한 Template 만들기'를 위해 어떤 파일(`index.php`,           
  `style.css`)부터 생성하며 시작해볼까요?**                                     
  위 내용에 대해 어떻게 생생각해?                                               
                                                                                
● 정확한 이해입니다. 특히 이 부분들이 핵심을 잘 짚었습니다:                     
                                                                                
  제 평가                                                                       
                                                                                
  ✅ 정확하게 캐치한 부분                                                       
                                                                                
  1. "선언적 vs 명령적" 비유                                                    
    - 레고 비유가 정확합니다. Block Theme의 진정한 가치가 그것입니다            
    - 사용자(비개발자)가 규칙을 따르기만 하면 되는 환경                         
  2. "블록 단위 로딩"의 성능 중요성                                             
    - 단순한 기술 최적화가 아니라, 스케일링 관점의 철학 전환                    
    - 처음 playground에서 theme.json 로딩 시간 vs functions.php의 불필요한 CSS  
  로드를 직접 비교해보면 체감할 것                                              
  3. 5단계의 실전성                                                             
    - the_content 필터로 이미지 캡션 수정 → 이건 실제 클라이언트 프로젝트에서도 
  자주 쓰는 패턴입니다                                                          
    - uploads의 이미지를 '학습 대상'으로 잡은 것이 좋은데, 추가로:              
    add_filter( 'wp_get_attachment_image', function( $html, $attachment_id ) {  
      // uploads의 모든 이미지에 lazy-load 속성 강제                            
      return str_replace( '<img ', '<img loading="lazy" ', $html );             
  }, 10, 2 );                                                                   
    - 이런 식으로 실제 성능 개선을 체감할 수 있습니다                           
                                                                                
  🎯 ACF 제안에 대해서                                                          
                                                                                
  정확한 판단입니다. 이유:                                                      
                                                                                
  - Block Theme의 진짜 가치: 단순한 "예쁜 테마" 제작이 아니라, 데이터 구조 →    
  표현 의 분리                                                                  
  - 실무 패턴: WordPress는 결국 **"구조화된 정보(메타 필드)를 다양하게          
  표시"**하는 CMS

  }

  지금 바로 시작할 단계:                                                        
                                                                                
  1. Playground에서 새 테마 폴더 생성                                           
  mkdir -p /home/nadle/para/resources/wordpress/playground/wp-content/themes/lea

  2. 최소 3개 파일 생성                                                         
    - style.css (테마 메타 정보)

    - functions.php (비워두기)                                                  
  3. WordPress 관리자에서 테마 활성화                                           
  4. uploads에 샘플 이미지 추가 후, index.php에 표시                            
                                                                                
  이 정도면 단계 1 완성입니다.

  당신의 이해도는 이미 "튜토리얼 따라하기" 수준을 넘어섰습니다. 이제 직접 손으로
   만들면서 "왜 이렇게 설계됐나"를 느끼는 단계인 것 같습니다.
